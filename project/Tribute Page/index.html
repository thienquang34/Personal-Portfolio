                        other applied science.

                        different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
                        varieties for each major climate on Earth.

                        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
                        well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.

                        supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
                        we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
                        are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
                        people were selecting the best breeds."
